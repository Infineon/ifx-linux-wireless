module they have selected. This would include but is not limited to the
following: NVRAM, clm_blob and MFG Binaries.


Instructions
------------
The WiFi driver is developed based on Linux v6.1.97. Older kernels need
use backports package. Below are examples of how to use this package
with an older kernel or linux-stable v6.1.97.

### Using backports with an older kernel (v4.14+)

Linux kernel image and WiFi driver modules need to be built separately.
Below is the example of using with iMX Linux v4.14.78:

#### Build the kernel image
```bash
#1. Have the BSP kernel source available
   git clone https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/linux-imx
   cd linux-imx
   git checkout imx_4.14.78_1.0.0_ga
#2. Set up build environment and kernel configuration
   source /opt/poky/1.8/environment-setup-cortexa7hf-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi
   make imx_v7_defconfig
#3. Edit .config and build cfg80211 as module
#     CONFIG_CFG80211=m
#     CONFIG_BCMDHD=n
#4. Enable below configs in .config
#     CONFIG_ASYMMETRIC_KEY_TYPE=y
#     CONFIG_ASYMMETRIC_PUBLIC_KEY_SUBTYPE=y
#     CONFIG_X509_CERTIFICATE_PARSER=y
#     CONFIG_PKCS7_MESSAGE_PARSER=y
#5. Build the Linux kernel image
   make oldconfig
   make zImage -j 8
#6. The kernel image is available here
   arch/arm/boot/zImage
```

#### Build the WiFi driver/backports modules
```bash
#1. Untar the Cypress backports package
    tar zxvf cypress-backports-*.tar.gz
    cd v6.1.97-backports
#2. (Native) compile local tools and generate .config (in a new terminal
#   without sourcing Yoctol toolchain settings)
    bash
    MY_KERNEL=<the 4.14.78 kernel path>
    make KLIB=$MY_KERNEL KLIB_BUILD=$MY_KERNEL defconfig-brcmfmac
#3. (Cross) compile kernel modules
    source /opt/poky/1.8/environment-setup-cortexa7hf-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi
    make KLIB=$MY_KERNEL KLIB_BUILD=$MY_KERNEL modules
#4. The kernel modules are available here
#      compat/compat.ko
#      net/wireless/cfg80211.ko
#      drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmutil/brcmutil.ko
#      drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/brcmfmac.ko
```

#### Device tree
```bash
#1. Download Infineon devicetree package
    git clone -b latest-v6.1 https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/ifx-linux-wireless.git
#2. Find your board's dtb file, for example
#      ifx-linux-wireless/devicetree/iMX6SX/4.14.78/imx6sx-sdb-btwifi-fmac.dtb
```
Note: If your board's dtb is not available in the cypress devicetree
      package, please refer to the available dts/dtsi files and create
      them for your board, then compile them for the dtb file. iMX dts
      files are located in linux-imx/arch/arm/boot/dts/ folder of the
      Linux kernel tree. Below command compiles a dtb file
```bash
    make ARCH=arm <devicetree name>.dtb
```

#### Load the cypress wifi driver
```bash
#1. Copy your boards's zImage and dtb files to the target board
    bash
    TARGET_IP=<target board IP>
    scp <dtb file> root@$TARGET_IP:/run/media/mmcblk1p1/cy.dtb
    scp <zImage file> root@$TARGET_IP:/run/media/mmcblk1p1/zImage_cy
#2. Copy firmware files to the target board
    git clone -b latest-v6.1 https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/ifx-linux-firmware.git
    scp ifx-linux-firmware/firmware/* root@$TARGET_IP:/lib/firmware/cypress
#3. Copy your nvram file (from board vendor) to the target board and rename it
    scp <nvram file> root@$TARGET_IP:/lib/firmware/cypress/<fw name>.txt
#      (fw name is your chip's *.bin file name in the cypress firmware package)
#4. Copy cypress kernel modules to the target board
    scp <module files> root@$TARGET_IP:/lib/modules/4.14.78
#5. (iMX console) Press ctrl-c after target boot to enter u-boot and configure it
#   for the new zImage/dtb files
   env print image fdt_file
   setenv image zImage_cy
   setenv fdt_file cy.dtb
   saveenv
   env print image fdt_file
   reset
#6. (iMX console) Boot up the target board with the above zImage and insmod cypress modules
    insmod /lib/modules/4.14.78/compat.ko
    insmod /lib/modules/4.14.78/cfg80211.ko
    insmod /lib/modules/4.14.78/brcmutil.ko
    insmod /lib/modules/4.14.78/brcmfmac.ko
```

### Using Linux Stable v6.1.97
```bash
#1. Download Linux stable kernel source
    wget https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/snapshot/linux-6.1.97.tar.gz
    tar zxvf linux-6.1.97.tar.gz
#2. In Linux root folder, untar/apply cypress patches with below bash commands
    cd linux-6.1.97
    tar zxvf cypress-patch*.tar.gz
    for i in cypress-patch/*.patch; do patch -p1 < $i; done
#3. Set kernel .config and enable below options, then compile kernel image
#      CONFIG_BRCMUTIL=y
#      CONFIG_BRCMFMAC=y
#      CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_SDIO=y
#      CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_PROTO_BCDC=y
#      CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_PCIE=y
#      CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_PROTO_MSGBUF=y
#4. (optional) Backup original firmware files
    cp /lib/firmware/cypress /lib/firmware/cypress-bak -r
#5. Update firmware files in /lib/firmware/cypress
    tar zxvf cypress-firmware*.tar.gz
    cp firmware/* /lib/firmware/cypress
#6. Boot the system with the new kernel image
```


Instructions - Hostap
---------------------
Hostpad/wpa_supplicant is the standard application for controlling WiFi devices.
Below is an example of cloning the Infineon GitHub repo and building
hostapd/wpa_supplicant binaries.

### Build the hostapd/wpa_supplicant binaries
```bash
#1. Download Hostap source and change the HEAD to commit 13837a031a78.
    git clone git://w1.fi/hostap.git
    cd hostap
    git checkout 13837a031a78
#2. In Hostap root folder, untar/apply cypress patches with below bash commands
    tar zxvf cypress-hostap_2_11-*.tar.gz
    for i in cypress-hostap_2_11-devel/*.patch; do patch -p1 < $i; done
#3. (Hostapd) in hostapd root directory, have a build time configuration file,
#   .config, and build hostapd and hostapd_cli
    cd hostapd
    cp defconfig_base .config
    make clean
    make
#4. (Wpa_supplicant) in wpa_supplicant root directory, have a build time
#   configuration file, .config, and build wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli
    cd wpa_supplicant
    cp defconfig_base .config
    make clean
    make
#5. The binaries are available here
#     hostap/hostapd/hostapd
#     hostap/hostapd/hostapd_cli
#     hostap/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant
#     hostap/wpa_supplicant/wpa_cli
```
Note 1: Set CONFIG_SAE=y in .config to enable WPA3-Personal (SAE) support.
      5459x and 43012 only supports sae_pwe 1 or 2 in hostapd.conf and wpa_supplicant.conf

Note 2: For commercial SAP use on an IOT device, we recommand to launch the AP with DTIM_PERIOD is 1.
      dtim_period=1 in hostapd.conf
